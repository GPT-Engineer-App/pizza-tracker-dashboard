# pizza-tracker-dashboard

A business dashboard showing sales, revenue, and other key metrics.Sure, here's a basic outline of how you can create a web app for a pizza tracker:

1. **Design**: Start by sketching out the user interface. It should be simple and intuitive. You can use tools like Adobe XD or Sketch for this. The design should match the warm and welcoming atmosphere of a pizzeria. Use relevant images, colors, and typography.

2. **Features**:

   - **Order Tracking**: This is the main feature. Users should be able to see the status of their order in real time. This can be divided into three stages: Preparation, Cooking, and Delivery.

   - **Time Logging**: The app should automatically record the time when an order moves from one stage to another. This data can be used for analysis and improvement of service.

   - **Alerts**: The app should send alerts when an order is ready for delivery. This can be done through push notifications or SMS.

   - **Performance Analysis**: The app should provide a summary of average delivery times. This can be displayed in a chart or graph for easy understanding.

3. **Development**: You can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. For back-end, you can use Node.js or Django. For real-time updates, consider using WebSockets or a similar technology.

4. **Database**: Use a database like MySQL or MongoDB to store order details, timestamps, and other relevant data.

5. **Testing**: Make sure to thoroughly test the app for any bugs or issues. This includes functionality testing, usability testing, performance testing, and security testing.

6. **Deployment**: Once the app is ready and tested, you can deploy it on a server. You can use services like AWS or Google Cloud for this.

7. **Maintenance and Updates**: After deployment, you'll need to regularly update the app and fix any issues that come up. You can also add new features based on user feedback.
